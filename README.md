## Hey, I'm David

I build developer tools and infrastructure software, mostly in Go.

Based in Washington, DC.

### What I'm working on

**[agentbox](https://github.com/davidsenack/agentbox)** — Sandboxed runtime for AI agents.

**[gastop](https://github.com/davidsenack/gastop)** — Terminal dashboard for multi-agent workspaces. Like htop, but for AI projects.

**[alloy](https://github.com/davidsenack/alloy)** — Fast, rootless package manager that installs sandboxed tools without touching your OS.

**[dotwatch](https://github.com/davidsenack/dotwatch)** — Dotfiles manager that auto-tracks config changes and syncs to GitHub.

**[gofetch](https://github.com/davidsenack/gofetch)** — Blazing-fast system info CLI, written in Go.
